@page CHANGES-UNRELEASED Unreleased changes

This page contains changes that will end up in 2.4

Changes from version 2.3 which are relevant for users:
- Changes leading to incompatible behavior:
  - A c++11 compliant compiler is required (see \issue{212}). This should mean:
    - gcc 4.8
    - clang 3.3
    - intel 15
- New collective variables:
  -  \ref DIMER (thanks to Marco Nava).
- Other changes:
  - \ref PBMETAD : multiple walkers using files (thanks to Marco De La Pierre).
  - \ref PBMETAD : adaptive gaussians
  - \ref PBMETAD : default names for GRID and FILE (usefull with many collective variables) 
  - \ref IMPLICIT : EEF1-SB implicit solvent solvation energy

Changes from version 2.3 which are relevant for developers:
  - A few fixes has been made to improve exception safety. Although we still cannot declare
    PLUMED totally exception safe (there are still many non-safe pointers around),
    this made it possible to add a regtest that actually tests erroneous cmd strings
    and erroneous inputs.
  - Due to the required c++11 support, travis-ci test on Ubuntu Precise has been removed.
